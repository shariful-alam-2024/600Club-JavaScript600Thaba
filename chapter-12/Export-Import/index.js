/* Default exports in JavaScript are a feature that allows a single value, function, or class to be exported from a module. When a default export is used in a module, it can be used with any name when imported.

Renaming facility:

If you use the default export, you can use any name when importing.
Increases code readability:

Default exports help to explain the main purpose of the module, as there is only one main function or class.
Advantages of exporting only one main function or class:

If a module contains only one important function or class, it is better to use the default export.
No need to use extra {} brackets:

You need to use {} when using normal (named) export, but it is not necessary when using default export.
